# .dotfiles
Dotfiles and custom config I use in MacOS to better suit my years-long muscle memory and workflow.

## VSCode
[keybindings.json](VSCode\keybindings.json) Binds keys shortcuts to work similar to Sublime Shortcuts in Windows. Remapping MacOS Modifier keys is needed for this to work as expected.
[settings.json](VSCode\settings.json) General Settings to make the editor more confortable and distraction free.
