# .dotfiles
Dotfiles and custom config I use in MacOS to better suit my years-long muscle memory and workflow.

# MacOS
* [DefaultKeyBinding.dict](MacOS/DefaultKeyBinding.dict) Binds Keys at the OS level. Move to `~/Library/KeyBindings/DefaultKeyBinding.dict`
* [ModifierKeys.png](MacOS/ModifierKeys.png) Screenshot of Modifier Keys Settings for Keychron Keyboards.

## VSCode
* [keybindings.json](VSCode/keybindings.json) Binds keys shortcuts to work similar to Sublime Shortcuts in Windows. Remapping MacOS Modifier keys is needed for this to work as expected.
* [settings.json](VSCode/settings.json) General Settings to make the editor more confortable and distraction free.
